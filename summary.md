## Personal Philosophy & Approach

I believe that access to STEM and robotics shouldn’t be limited to a select few — they should be accessible to everyone, no matter their background or resources. That belief is what drives everything I do, from my "Robotics for Everyone" initiative to the workshops I lead in my community and my focus on developing low-cost, practical solutions for STEM education.

What sets me apart isn’t just academic performance. it's the way I connect technical, hands-on work with a real-world impact. Whether it’s mentoring students or working on research projects, I’m always focused on helping others grow through hands-on learning, shared knowledge, and mentorship. My goal isn’t just to push the boundaries of what I can achieve, but to make sure others can come along for the journey too.

## Cultural Heritage

Beyond my work in STEM, I’ve stayed connected to my cultural roots through South Indian classical music. I’ve been learning Carnatic vocal music for 7 years and have spent 8 years on the bamboo flute. I also earned a $4,000 Texas Folklife scholarship that allowed me to explore the philosophical ideas in classical compositions.
