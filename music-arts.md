**Seven years of experience** in South Indian classical vocal tradition. Carnatic music is one of the world's oldest and most sophisticated musical systems, requiring understanding of ragas (melodic frameworks), talas (rhythmic cycles), and improvisational techniques.

### Texas Folklife Apprentice Program

**Eight years of study** in traditional Indian bamboo flute and played in several concerts. The flute is considered one of the most complex instruments in Indian classical music as it requires breath control and precise finger movements.

### Cultural Preservation Impact
Contributing to preservation of ancient musical traditions through performance and research. Carnatic music represents over 1,000 years of musical evolution and philosophical inquiry, serving as a bridge between ancient wisdom and contemporary artistic expression. I also sang and explained the meaning for 7 songs to spread awareness about Carnatic music.
