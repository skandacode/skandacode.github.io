## Research Experience & Publications

### Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium - International Conference on Additive Manufacturing
**University of Texas at Austin (2022, 2023, 2024)**

*Distinguished as the only high school team to present at this prestigious international conference featuring 500+ research papers*

- **2024 Publication:** "The Educational Value of 3D Printing CubeSats" - Investigated how CubeSats have democratized access to space within the educational community by providing a cost-effective, hands-on platform for space-based missions and experiments. Our work utilized a reconfigurable 1U (100mm x 100mm x 100mm) CubeSat architecture to enable a wide range of student-led experiments in vision, communication, IMU, solar power storage/distribution, and dynamic loads. We leveraged Solid Freeform Fabrication to manufacture modular structural elements that facilitate ease of assembly/disassembly, rapid debugging, and flexible mounting of experimental modules. These design innovations allow students to minimize assembly time, reconfigure satellites for different experiments, efficiently route cables, and access internal components for maintenanceâ€”making complex aerospace concepts accessible through practical construction and iterative testing
- **2023 Publication:** "Cost-Effective 3D Printing Solutions for Educational and Competitive Robotics" - Addressed the persistent high cost of structural components and brackets in robotics, despite the affordability of open-source microcontrollers, drives, and sensors. Inspired by the Robotics for Everyone initiative, we developed a suite of easy-to-manufacture 3D printed parts for structural robot chassis assembly, sensor and electronics mounting, power supply integration, and various power drives. Our ecosystem is built around extrusion structures and tubular elements, with 3D printing enabling rapid prototyping, testing, and qualification of parts. We also designed specialized fixtures for mounting cameras, supporting advanced machine learning and computer vision experiments. This approach significantly reduces barriers to entry, enabling broader participation in robotics by making high-quality structural components accessible and affordable for educational and competitive teams
- **2022 Publication:** "Flat Pattern Simplification for Educational Manufacturing Cost Reduction" - Explored how educational and competitive robotics serve as effective tools for hands-on STEM learning, but are often limited by the high cost of physical components. Recognizing that commercial kits (LEGO, VEX, REV, etc.) are inaccessible to many communities worldwide, our "Robotics for All" initiative developed a versatile, cost-effective platform providing a minimum set of essential parts. These parts can be integrated with general-purpose or custom controllers/microcomputers (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, BBC micro:bit) and a variety of sensors and camera modules, enabling experiments in robot navigation, process planning, object manipulation, industrial architectures, and machine learning. Solid Freeform Fabrication was used to manufacture, verify, and iteratively improve piece part designs, emphasizing low cost without compromising learning opportunities or experimental versatility.
