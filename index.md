## About Me

With perfect standardized test scores (ACT: 36/36, PSAT: 1520/1520) and AP Scholar with Distinction recognition, I've built a foundation of academic rigor while pursuing hands-on engineering and research experiences. What sets me apart is not just academic achievement, but the ability to translate complex technical concepts into accessible educational programs and real-world solutions.

## What Makes Me Unique

- **Research Pioneer:** Only high school team presenting at international engineering conferences with 3 published papers
- **Robotics Excellence:** World Championship Division Winner, #1 Texas, founded and coached 22+ teams
- **Educational Impact:** Taught 150+ students, generated $8,000+ annually through STEM programs
- **Technical Depth:** 9 years competitive robotics, professional internships, USACO Silver level programmer

## Personal Philosophy

I believe in making advanced STEM concepts accessible to everyone, regardless of background or resources. This philosophy drives my "Robotics for All" initiative, my community teaching efforts, and my research focus on cost-effective educational solutions.

Beyond STEM, I maintain deep connections to my cultural heritage through South Indian classical music, earning a prestigious $4,000 Texas Folklife scholarship for my dedication to preserving traditional art forms.
