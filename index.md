## My Story

With perfect standardized test scores (ACT: 36/36, PSAT: 1520/1520) and AP Scholar with Distinction recognition, I've built a foundation of academic rigor while pursuing hands-on engineering and research experiences. What sets me apart is not just academic achievement, but the ability to translate complex technical concepts into accessible educational programs and real-world solutions.

## Core Expertise Areas

## Personal Philosophy

I believe in making advanced STEM concepts accessible to everyone, regardless of background or resources. This philosophy drives my "Robotics for All" initiative, my community teaching efforts, and my research focus on cost-effective educational solutions.

My unique combination of technical depth, research experience, and educational leadership reflects a commitment to not just personal excellence, but to lifting others through shared knowledge and mentorship.

## Cultural Connections

Beyond STEM, I maintain deep connections to my cultural heritage through South Indian classical music. Seven years of Carnatic vocal training and eight years of bamboo flute mastery earned me a prestigious $4,000 Texas Folklife scholarship to research the philosophical concepts in classical compositions.
