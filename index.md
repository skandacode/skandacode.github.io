# Arun 'Skanda' Rebbapragada

I am currently a senior at RL Turner High School in Carrollton, TX, ranking 3rd out of 500 students (top 1% of my class). I strive to not only have a solid academic performance, but to have an effect on the real world. I have presented at international conferences, published several papers, and spread awareness of robotics and STEM around the world.

## About Me

I have high standardized test scores, including a superscore of 36 out of 36 on the ACT and 1520 out of 1520 on the PSAT. I also received the AP Scholar with Distinction recognition. I combine strong academics with hands-on engineering and research experiences.

## What Makes Me Unique

- **Research Pioneer:** Part of the only high school team presenting at international engineering conferences with 3 published papers
- **Robotics Excellence:** World Championship Division Winner, #1 Texas, founded and coached 22+ teams
- **Educational Impact:** Taught 200+ students, generated $8,000+ annually through teaching robotics
- **Technical Depth:** 9 years competitive robotics, professional internships, USACO Silver level programmer, USAPhO qualifier

## Personal Philosophy

I believe in making STEM and robotics accessible to everyone, regardless of background or resources. This drives my "Robotics for Everyone" initiative, my community teaching efforts, and my focus on researching cost-effective solutions for teaching robotics.

Beyond STEM, I maintain connections to my cultural heritage through South Indian classical Carnatic music. I have recieved a $4000 grant to pursue singing, and gave a performance singing songs from different composers and explaining the meaning and context behind each of those songs.
