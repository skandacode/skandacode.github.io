# Arun 'Skanda' Rebbapragada

I am currently a senior at RL Turner High School in Carrollton, TX, ranking 2nd out of 500 students (top 1% of my class). I strive to not only have a solid academic performance, but to have an effect on the real world. I have presented at international conferences, published several papers, and spread awareness of robotics and STEM around the world.

## About Me

I have high standardized test scores, including a superscore of 36 out of 36 on the ACT and 1520 out of 1520 on the PSAT. I also received the AP Scholar with Distinction recognition. I combine strong academics with hands-on engineering and research experiences.

## What Makes Me Unique

- **Research Experience:** Part of the only high school team presenting at international engineering conferences with 3 published papers
- **Robotics Excellence:** World Championship Division Winner, #1 Texas, founded and coached 22+ teams
- **Educational Impact:** Taught 200+ students, generated $8,000+ annually through teaching robotics
- **Technical Depth:** 9 years competitive robotics, professional internships, USACO Silver level programmer, USAPhO qualifier

## Personal Philosophy

I believe that access to STEM and robotics shouldn’t be limited to a select few. They should be accessible to everyone, no matter their background or resources. That belief drives everything I do, from my "Robotics for Everyone" initiative to the workshops I lead in my community and my focus on developing low-cost, practical solutions for STEM education.

In addition to my academics, I connect technical, hands-on work with a real-world impact. I’m always focused on helping others grow through hands-on learning, shared knowledge, and mentorship, whether it’s mentoring students or working on research projects. My goal isn’t just to push the boundaries of what I can achieve, but to make sure others can come along for the journey too.

Beyond STEM, I maintain connections to my cultural heritage through South Indian classical Carnatic music. I have recieved a $4000 grant to pursue singing, and gave a performance singing songs from different composers and explaining the meaning and context behind each of those songs.
