<h2>2024-2025 - Into The Deep <img src="assets/images/intothedeeplogo.png" height="12" style="vertical-align: middle; display: inline;"></h2>

### Robot Design
 -  Features active intake to pick up samples from around the field
 -  Utilizes a "Power Take-off" to switch between torque(while hanging) and speed(throughout the rest of the game)
 -  Fully custom carbon fiber drivetrain
 -  Uses Mechanum wheels to strafe sideways

[Former Solo World Record](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO0BuFX0f84&ab_channel=FTCRoboPlayers)
<br>

### Season Accomplishments
- After our first event, we were undefeated and were ranked number 1 in the world
- In our first qualifier, we won the Inspire Award (the championship award), and the winning alliance captain, the two top awards given in any event. We also had the second highest score in the world
- In our interleague tournament we also won the winning alliance captain, and were ranked as number 1 in North Texas. 
- In December, we had the solo world record, which we held for over a month
- At the North Texas regional competition, we won the Inspire award (Championship award) and qualified to the World Championships, as well as being ranked number 1 in North Texas for the robot game, and number 7 in the world
- At Worlds, we were the Winning Alliance Captain of our division and were one of the top 5 robots in the world. We qualified for the Maryland Tech Invitational in Johns Hopkins and one of the 3 US teams invited to the Bucharest Twin Cup in Romania

<h2>2022-2023 PowerPlay <img src="assets/images/powerplaylogo.jpg" height="12" style="vertical-align: middle; display: inline;"></h2>

### Robot Design
 - Uses claw to pick up cones from around the field
 - GoBilda mecanum drivetrain
 - Used a turret to place cones on poles without the drivetrain moving
 - Utilized 2 linear extensions: one on deposit, and one to intake/grab cones
