After our first event, we were undefeated and were ranked number 1 in the world. In our first qualifier, we won the Inspire Award (the championship award), and the winning alliance captain, which are the two top awards given in any event. We also had the second highest score in the world. In our interleague tournament we also won the winning alliance captain, and were subsequently ranked as number 1 in north texas. In December, we had the solo world record, which we held for over a month. At the North Texas regional competition, we won the Inspire award (Championship award), which qualified us to the World Championships, as well as being ranked number 1 in North Texas for the robot game, and number 7 in the world. At Worlds, we were the Winning Alliance Captain and were one of the top 5 robots in the world. We qualified for the Maryland Tech Invitational in Johns Hopkins and as one of the 3 US teams invited to the Bucharest Twin Cup in Romania.
