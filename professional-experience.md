## **Research & Publications**

### **Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium Papers** (2022-2024)
*International Conference on Additive Manufacturing - University of Texas at Austin*

**2024: "[The Educational Value of 3D Printing CubeSats](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/36639237-135a-4ed4-b87b-8fcb222080a5/content)"**
- CubeSats only cost a few hundred dollars to manufacture, and they provide hands-on experience in 3D printing, CAD, and building, so I co-authored a paper showing the potential of CubeSats in education. 
- I was responsible for CADing the CubeSat. I came up with a reconfigurable 1U CubeSat architecture for student experiments, meaning that the solar panels can be adjusted and put at various angles. This allows students to experiment with which orientations best fit their design. 
- The whole CubeSat has a modular design which enables rapid prototyping and testing. Also, the students find it easier to assemble our CubeSat compared to designs that are fully custom and set in stone.

**2023: "[Cost-Effective 3D Printing Solutions for Educational Robotics](https://utw10945.utweb.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/2023/169%20Developmentof3DPrintablePartLibraryforEasytoManufactureComponentsforEducationalandComp1.pdf)"**
- This paper addresses the high-cost barriers in competitive robotics. Robotics kits often cost thousands of dollars, making access extremely difficult in certain situations. 
- We designed and open-sourced 3D printed structural components and mounting systems so that anyone with access to a 3D printer can get started with robotics. Almost anyone can access a 3D printer at their library, so this project makes learning more cost effective than other options. 
- Whereas other kits can cost upwards of \$1000, the kit that we designed costs only around \$100 for the structural components. This is due to the fact that we give the CAD models directly to the customer for them to 3D print rather than mill it out of aluminum ourselves. 

**2022: "[Flat Pattern Simplification for Educational Manufacturing](https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/items/7bde374f-eb36-4a5a-9c22-4140e7618f20)"**
- Cost-effective alternatives to commercial robotics kits due to the usage of flat, laser-cuttable parts that can easily be mass produced. 
- Milling parts out of aluminum takes a lot of time and material, but simplifying the geometry to only flat parts allows a laser to quickly cut out the part, and one flat sheet of plastic can be cut into multiple parts
- These parts form a build system that is compatible with open source electronics. The build system provides the same level of learning as a milled kit, but at a significantly lowered cost. 
- We formed the organization Robotics for Everyone in our goal to expand robotics to different regions. The CAD models for the parts are open-sourced on the Robotics for Everyone website.

### **2023: Pattern Discovery and Machine Learning Lab at UT Dallas**

**Vehicle Trajectory Prediction**
- Spent 30 hours per week for 10 weeks over the summer
- Used Pytorch, OpenCV, and Python
- I developed a CNN-based model in PyTorch to predict vehicle trajectories using a list of pre-generated paths. I achieved 83% accuracy out of 400+ paths.
- I then used the predicted trajectories of surrounding vehicles to enable an autonomous car to proactively avoid collisions using reinforcement learning. The car predicts the trajectories and learns to avoid hitting the other cars. I has able to dramatically reduce the chance of a collision compared to independently choosing the best trajectory. 

## **Work Experience**

### **Software Developer Intern - State Farm** (Summer 2025)
*Enterprise-level software development and cloud migration*
- Successfully migrated application components from AWS Lambda to Amazon EKS. 
- Gained experience in working with Gitlab pipelines and fixing security vulnerabilities
- Collaborated directly with software engineers on production insurance policy processing systems, gaining experience with enterprise level software development practices and industry standards.
- Unified 2 application components into a single service, resulting in reduced costs for the company. 
- Gained exposure to enterprise software development methodologies, version control systems, and collaborative development practices used in industry.
